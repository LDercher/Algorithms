.3.1.
--------------------
Consider the directed acyclic graph G in Figure 3.10. How many topological orderings does it have?

- We know that node a must come first since it has no edges coming into it, and that f must be the last since it has no edges leaving it.
- We also know d must come before e, and b must come before c
- This leaves us with the following possible orderings
    - {a,b,c,d,e,f}
    - {a,d,e,b,c,f}
    - {a,b,d,c,e,f}
    - {a,d,b,c,e,f}
    - {a,b,d,e,c,f}
    - {a,d,b,e,c,f}

.3.3.
--------------------
Modify algorithm for computing topological ordering of a DAG to returns either: 
    - The topological ordering
    - a cycle if the graph is not a DAG

    - maintian list output list L
    - for each node v in G
        - if a node v w/ no incoming edges exists
            - Delete v from G
                - Recursively compute topological ordering of G - {v}
                    - append v to L
        - else, a cycle exists
            - take all possible paths from v until v is reached again. 
--------------------



.3.3.9
--------------------
Suppose that an n-node undirected graph G = (V,E) contains two nodes s and t s.t. the distance between the two nodes is strictly great than n/2. Show that there must exist a node v in between s and t s.t. deleting it would destroy all s to t paths. Give an algorithm with runtime O(m + n) to find node v

- Use BFS starting from node s until t is reached
