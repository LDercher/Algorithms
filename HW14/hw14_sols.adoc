.6.20.
--------------------
Suppose you’re managing a consulting team of expert computer hackers, and each week you have to choose a job for them to undertake. Now, as you can well imagine, the set of possible jobs is divided into those that arelow-stress (e.g., setting up a Website for a class at the loca lelementary school) and those that are high-stress (e.g., protecting the nation’s most valuable secrets, or helping a desperate group of Cornell students finish a project that has something to do with compilers). The basic question, each week, is whether to take on a low-stress job or a high-stress job.

If you select a low-stress job for your team in week i, then you get a revenue of i > 0 dollars; if you select a high-stress job, you get a revenue of hi > 0 dollars. The catch, however, is that in order for the team to take on a high-stress job in week i, it’s required that they do no job (of either type) in week i?1; they need a full week of prep time to get ready for the crushing stress level. On the other hand, it’s okay for them to take a lowstress job in week i even if they have done a job (of either type) in week i?1.

So, given a sequence of n weeks, a plan is specified by a choice of “low-stress,” “high-stress,” or “none” for each of the n weeks, with the property that if “high-stress” is chosen for week i > 1, then “none” has to be chosen for week i?1. (It’s okay to choose a high-stress job in week 1.) The value of the plan is determined in the natural way: for each i, you add i to the value if you choose “low-stress” in week i, and you add hi to the value if you choose “high-stress” in week i. (You add 0 if you choose “none” in week i.)

The problem. Given sets of values 1, 2,...,n and h1,h2,...,hn, find a plan of maximum value. (Such a plan will be called optimal.)

Example. Suppose n=4, and the values of i and hi are given by the following table. Then the plan of maximum value would be to choose “none” in week 1, a high-stress job in week 2, and low-stress jobs in weeks 3 and 4. The value of this plan would be 0+50+10+10=70.

|================================
|  |Week 1|Week 2|Week 3|Week 4
|l |10    |1     |10    |10
|h |5     |50    |5     |1
|================================

(a) Show that the following algorithm does not correctly solve this problem,bygiving an instance on which it does not return the correct answer.

    For iterations i = 1 to n
        If h_i+1 > l_i + l_i+1:
            Output "choose no job in week i"
            Output "choose a high-stress job in week i + 1"
            Continue with iteration i + 2
        else:
            Output "Choose a low-stress job in week i"
            Continue with iteration i + 1

To avoid problems with overflowing array bounds, we define hi=i=0 when i > n. In your example, say what the correct answer is and also what the above algorithm finds.

consider the given algorithm performed on the preceding table with n=4

for the first iteration of the loop (i=1) we have the condition being checked equal to 5 > 10 + 1. This is clearly false so we have chose a low stress job in the first iteration with hi = 10 and we continue on to the next iteration

For the second iteration (i=2) we are checking the condition equal to 50 > 11. Which is true, and hence we choose no job in week 2 and we have to choose a high stress job in week three with hi = 5. We know have total profit 15. We then continue to iteration 4.

On our third and final iteration with i = 4 we are checking the condition 0 > 10 + 0. We choose a low stess job in the last iteration which gives us an additional profit of 1. 

This i much less th the ideal plan with 70 profit. 

The problem is starting i = 1. Starting i = 0 gives us the optimal plan.



(b) Give an efficient algorithm that takes values for 1, 2,...,n and h1,h2,...,hn and returns the value of an optimal plan


For iteration i = 0 to n:
     if hi+1 >li + li+1:
        Output “Choose no job in week i”
        Output “Choose a high-stress job in week i+1”
        Continue with iteration i+2
    else:
        Output “Choose a low-stress job in week i”
        Continue with iteration i+1.

explanation:
    iterations
     i = 0:
      cond: 0 > 10
      output: no work is done in week 0
              cont to week 1
     i = 1:
      cond: 50 > 11
      output: choose no job in week 1
              choose high stress job in week 2 
              hi = 50 
              move to i = 3
     i = 3:
      cond: 1 > 20
      output: choose a low stress job in week 3.
              hi = 50 + 10
              continue to iteration 4
     i = 4:
      cond: 0 > 10 
            choose a low stress job in week 4
            hi = 50 + 10 + 10
