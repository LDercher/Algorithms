--------------------
Use the function rand_weight_graph to generate a random weighted graph with 10 nodes. Use print G
and print w to print the graph and the weight function.

(i) Draw your graph.
(ii) Pick a node s and trace a run of Dijkstra’s algorithm on your graph starting from node s. Trace
the running of the algorithm by making a table showing, at each loop iteration, the state of the
heap, what edges are being added to the tree, etc.
(iii) Repeat the above part using Prim’s algorithm (use the same starting point s).
(iv) Repeat the first part using Kruskal’s algorithm.

--------------------
Let G = <G; E> be an undirected connected graph with weight function w : E → R such that
• w(u, v) ≥ 0 for all edges (u, v) ∈ E,
• all edges weights are the same (that is, w(u, v) = w(x, y) implies (u, v) = (x, y)).
Recall from exercise 4.8 that the minimum spanning tree for such a graph and weight function is unique.
Define the second best minimal spanning tree as follows. If T is the unique minimal spanning tree of G
and S is another spanning tree such thatModify algorithm for computing topological ordering of a DAG to returns either: 
    - The topological ordering
    - a cycle if the graph is not a DAG

    - maintian list output list L
    - for each node v in G
        - if a node v w/ no incoming edges exists
            - Delete v from G
                - Recursively compute topological ordering of G - {v}
                    - append v to L
        - else, a cycle exists
            - take all possible paths from v until v is reached again. 
w(S) = min {w(R) | R is a spanning tree of G and R (not)= T}

,
then we say that S is the second best minimal spanning tree of G.
(i) Show by a counterexample that although the minimal spanning tree is unique in this situation, the
second best minimal spanning tree need not be.
(ii) Let T = <G; E_T> be the minimal spanning tree of G. Prove that G has edges (u, v) ∈ E_T and
(x, y) (not)∈ E_T such that the tree S obtained from T by deleting edge (u, v) and adding edge (x, y) is a
second best minimal spanning tree.
(iii) Give an efficient algorithm to compute the second best minimal spanning tree.

.4.8.
--------------------
Suppose you given a connected graph G, with edge costs that are all disticnt. Prove that G has a minimum spanning tree
--------------------


.4.11.
--------------------
Suppose you are given a connected graph G = (V, E), with a cost ce on
each edge e. In an earlier problem, we saw that when all edge costs are
distinct, G has a unique minimum spanning tree. However, G may have
many minimum spanning trees when the edge costs are not all distinct.
Here we formulate the question: Can Kruskal’s Algorithm be made to find
all the minimum spanning trees of G?
Recall that Kruskal’s Algorithm sorted the edges in order of increasing
cost, then greedily processed edges one by one, adding an edge e as
long as it did not form a cycle. When some edges have the same cost, the
phrase “in order of increasing cost” has to be specified a little more carefully:
we’ll say that an ordering of the edges is valid if the corresponding
sequence of edge costs is nondecreasing. We’ll say that a valid execution
of Kruskal’s Algorithm is one that begins with a valid ordering of the
edges of G.
For any graph G, and any minimum spanning tree T of G, is there a
valid execution of Kruskal’s Algorithm on G that produces T as output?
Give a proof or a counterexample.
