Recall that VertexCover (G, k) is the decision problem
    Input: a graph G, an integer k,
    Output: whether G has a vertex cover of size k.
Suppose  that  we  have  an  algorithm  to  solve  this  problem  in  polynomial  time.   Use  this  algorithm  to
produce another algorithm to actually find a vertex cover S⊆G
of minimal size (that is, solving the optimization problem takes at most polynomially more work than solving the decision problem)

suppose we have IndepSet S s.t. elements of S represent edges in graph G in the form of an adjacency list. The edges in G will form independent sets of nodes. Taking the inverse of set s to represent G \ S. We have a vertx covering. Hence I will take the largest indepSet found to be the inverse of the largest vertex covering.

G in form of AdjList

max_k = -1
 for k in G:
    if indepSet(G,k):
        max_k = k
return max_k

 Let U be  a  set  with |U|= n, S = (S_1, . . . , S_m)  a  collection  of subsets  of U,  and k an  integer.   The problem SetPack (U,S,k) is
    Input: U,S,k as above,
    Output: whether there is a subcollection R = (S_i1, . . . S_ik) of size k such that no two distinct members of R intersect. 
Prove that IndepSet ≤_p SetPack

intuition: IndepSet finds one set setpack finds multiple
Again suppose we have IndepSet S s.t. elements of S represent edges in graph G in the form of an adjacency list.  Let G be a graph s.t. it is totally disconnected. The setpack G (converted to an adjList) is eqalt to S.

Define Colorable (G, k) to be the problem
    Input:graph G, integer k,
    Output:whether G is k-colorable.
Suppose  that  we  have  an  algorithm  to  solve  this  problem  in  polynomial  time.   Use  this  algorithm  to produce another algorithm to actually find a k-coloring of G such that k is minimal.

min_k = 0
for k in range (|G|..0):
    if Colorable(G,k):
        min_k = k

  min_k

colored_nodes = []

color = -1 for all nodes in G

while |colored_nodes| < |G|:
    for i in G:
        for j in G[i]:
            color_k = true
            new_k = -1
            for k in range min_k:
                if G[i] not in colored_nodes:
                    if color[j] != k:
                     color_k = false
                     new_k = k
        if color_k:
            color[i] = new_k

return color
