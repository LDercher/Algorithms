.3.2.
--------------------
Find alg to detect a cycle in a graph. Return cycle

-Assume the graph is connected or choose a connected component of the graph
 - take arbirary node n as the vertex
 - perform DFS on n
 - if at any point an edge from a node to a seen vertex is encountered then there is a cycle
 - get the cycle by tracing back through the path to the seen node
 - return the cycle
--------------------
 
 
.3.4.
--------------------
detect if classification of butterfly species is consistent

-Draw graph where where nodes represent butterflies, blue edge ands red edges connecting nodes representing same types of butterflies
    - we have connected graph G = (V,E) and specied vertex u -> V
    - perform DFS on u to get tree T which contains all nodes f G
    - perform BFS on u to get equivalent tree T
        -observe G = T
--------------------


.3.6.
---------------------------------
prove G = T

- Suppose G has an edge e = {a,b} that does not belong to T

---------------------------------


.3.7.
---------------------------------
prove or disprove claim
- Let G be a graph on n nodes, where n is an even number. If every mode of G has dgree at least n/2, then G is connected.
