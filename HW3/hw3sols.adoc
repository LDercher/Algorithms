.3.2.
--------------------
Find alg to detect a cycle in a graph. Return cycle

-Assume the graph is connected or choose a connected component of the graph
 - take arbirary node n as the vertex
 - perform DFS on n
 - if at any point an edge from a node to a seen vertex is encountered then there is a cycle
 - get the cycle by tracing back through the path to the seen node
 - return the cycle
--------------------
 
 
.3.4.
--------------------
detect if classification of butterfly species is consistent

-Draw graph where where nodes represent butterflies, blue edge ands red edges connecting nodes representing different types of butterflies
    - we have connected graph G = (V,E) and specied vertex u -> V
    - perform DFS on u to get tree T which contains all nodes f G
    - perform BFS on u to get equivalent tree T
        -observe G = T
--------------------


.3.6.
---------------------------------
prove G = T
T = BFSTree(G,u) = DFSTree(G, u)
- Assume G = T
- Suppose G has an edge e = {a,b} that does not belong to T
    - if e is not in T then it b was either
        - Visited through a path from an earlier concentric sweep of the nodes in the BFS
        - Visited along another DFS search path in the DFS case
    
- observe in the DFS tree and BFS from node u in G, there is a possibility to miss different edges in BFS and DFS
- The only way to avoid this is to have T contain all edges in G

---------------------------------


.3.7.
---------------------------------
prove or disprove claim
- Let G be a graph on n nodes, where n is an even number. If every mode of G has dgree at least n/2, then G is connected.

-Assume G is not connected.
    - number of edges in graph with nodes n div by 2 u + v = n  is at most
        - (u - 1)(u -2) / 2 + (v - 1)(v - 2) /2 edges
        - or n^2 - 2u(n - u) - (3n-4) / 2 edges
    - because 1 < u < n which is smaller than n^2/2
    - if every vertex has a degree of at least n/2 then the number of edges must be at least n^2/2
    - Therefore there must be a node with a degree less than n/2
