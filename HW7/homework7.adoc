.ap1. 
--------------------
Let G be a directed graph. Prove or disprove: if every node n ∈ G has in-deg(n) > 0, then G has a
cycle.
--------------------
 
 







.ap2.
--------------------
Let G be a graph. We say an edge (u, v) crosses the cut S if it has one edge in S and the other in G \ S.
We say that an edge (u, v) is light for S if it has minimum weight amongst all the edges which cross S.
Let
M = { edges (u, v) | for some cut S, (u, v) is light}
.
Give a simple example of a connected graph G such that M does not form the edges of a minimum
spanning tree.
--------------------











.ap3.
--------------------
3. Suppose that all the edge weights of G are positive and the G does not have any self-loops.
(i) Prove that any subset of the edges which connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must
be a tree.
(ii) If we allow edge weights to also be negative, is the previous part still true? If it is, then prove it. If
it isn’t then provide a counterexample.
--------------------











.4.2.
--------------------
T or F
    (a) G is graph. T is MST on G. Sqaure weights of edges on G. Is T still a MST?

    (b) let p be a shortest path on G. Square weights. Still shortest path?
--------------------









.4.18.
--------------------
Given edge e = (v,w), time = t, f_e(t) will return preticed arrival time at w. Design alg to minimize travel time.
