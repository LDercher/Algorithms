.6.20.
--------------------
Suppose it’s nearing the end of the semester and you’re taking n courses, each with a final project that still has to be done. Each project will be graded on the following scale: It will be assigned an integer number on a scale of 1 to g > 1, higher numbers being better grades. Your goal, of course, is to maximize your average grade on the n projects.

You have a total of H > n hours in which to work on the n projects cumulatively, and you want to decide how to divide up this time. For simplicity, assume H is a positive integer, and you’ll spend an integer number of hours on each project. To figure out how best to divide up your time, you’ve come up with a set of functions {fi:i = 1, 2, . . . , n} (rough estimates, of course) for each of your n courses; if you spend h≤H hours on the project for course i, you’ll get a grade of fi(h). (You may assume that the functions fi are nondecreasing: if h < h' , then fi(h)≤fi(h' ).)

So the problem is: Given these functions {fi}, decide how many hours to spend on each project (in integer values only) so that your average grade, as computed according to the fi, is as large as possible. In order to be efficient, the running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in n, g, and H; none of these quantities should appear as an exponent in your running time.

let the (i,h) subproblem be the one which we wants to maximize our grade on the first i courses using at most h hours. 

let A[i,h] be the max total grade you can recieve for this subproblem. 

A[0,h] = 0 for all h
A[i,0] = sum j = 1 to i f_j(0)
say we spend k hours on course i for some value 0 <= k <= h 
A[i,h] = max (0<=k<=h) [f_i(k) + A[i-1,h-k]

In your solution to problem 6.20 in this homework, draw the subproblem graph (not the recursion tree)
for n = 5 and H = 10, g = 4.

2. Consider the matrix-chain multiplication problem with dimension sequence D = hd0, d1, . . . , dni. In this
problem, we have to split a series of matrices with parentheses at some point. Suppose that we choose
the matrix Ak at which to split
Ai
· · · Ak · · · Aj −→ (Ai
· · · Ak)(Ak+1 · · · Aj )

by selecting k in order to minimize di−1dkdj . This is a greedy divide-and-conquer approach.
Give an example to show that this approach sometimes yields a suboptimal solution.

--------------------
Draw the recursion tree for the merge sort algorithm on an array of 16 elements. Explain why memoization
fails to speed up a good divide-and-conquer algorithm such as merge sort.

--------------------


.ap4.
--------------------
Recall the lightest path problem: given graph G and nodes s, t, find the path in G from s to t of least
weight. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a greedy solution to this problem. This problem assumes that s and t
are fixed.
(i) Deduce the Bellman equation (the recursive weight equation) for this problem.

 f(n) = n * log n

(ii) Implement your function recursively in the associated python file.

def shortest_path_recursive(G, w, s, t, M=[]): # {{{
  
  if not M:
    M = [ None for _ in G ]

  if s == t:
    return [s], 0

  mind_dist = float('inf')

  for u in G[s]:
    new_path, new_dist = shortest_path_recursive(G,w,u,t,M)
    new_dist = w[(s,u)] + new_dist
    if new_dist < mind_dist:
      mind_dist = new_dist
      min_path = [u] + new_path
      M[u] = min_path, mind_dist
  return min_path, mind_dist

(iii) Implement your function iteratively in the associated python file.

def shortest_path_iterative(G, w, s, t): # {{{
  M = [ None for _ in G ]
  dist = [ float('inf') for _ in G]
  M[s] = [s],0
  v = s
  while v != t:
    min_dist = float('inf')
    min_path = []
    next_node = find_first_occurence_index(None,M)
    new_min = False
    for u in G[v]:
      if M[u] == None and u != v:
        if w[(u,v)] < min_dist:
          min_dist = w[(u,v)]
          min_path = [u]
          next_node = u
          new_min = True
    if new_min:
      M[next_node] = (min_path + M[v][0],min_dist + M[v][1])
    v = next_node

  return M[t]

(iv) What is the Θ-complexity of your solution?

 
    Θ(nlogn)

    note: memoization reduces from n^2 complexity if done correctly.
